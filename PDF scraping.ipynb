The hydraulic jack seals were replaced and the piston was filed; the elevator was tested and returned to service. The elevator was out of service from 5/13/19 to 5/15/19 due to an entrapment investigation. Repairs and adjustments were made to the car and hoistway doors and interlocks, rail guide clamps in the shaftway were secured and the elevator cab was squared and secured; the elevator was tested and returned to service.

       " 'This elevator was out of service on multiple occasions due to entrapments. The entrapment that occurred on 4/7/19 was the result of the controller microprocessor board malfunctioning. The microprocessor was replaced and parameters were programmed; the elevator was tested and returned to service. The entrapment that occurred on 5/13/19 was the result of the valve body not operating correctly. The valve body was replaced and adjusted; the elevator was inspected, tested and returned to service. The entrapment that occurred on 5/18/19 was the result of the elevator not making the top landing. Leaks on the oil pipes were repaired and hydraulic fluid was added to the oil reservoir. The damaged interlocks at the upper landing hoistway doors were replaced and adjusted; the elevator was inspected, tested and returned to service. The entrapment that occurred on 5/22/19 was the result of the pump motor belt slipping due to oil.
